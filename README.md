# Csv-Data-Manager


This project retrieves a CSV file from the database, checks that it is in the proper format, and then lists the data on the front side.

Once the CSV file is loaded in the proper format, the user can actively display the instant age calculation by customising the date of birth column.

In addition, the CSV view also shows avatars consisting of users' initials according to their first and last names.
